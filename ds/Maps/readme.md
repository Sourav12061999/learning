### Concepts around Maps
- Map is a ordered collection of key-value pairs, Both keys and values can be of any data type.
- To retrive a value you can use the corresponding key.
- Maps are iterable. They can be used with a for of loop.

### Object vs Map:- 
- Objects are unordered but Maps are ordered.
- Keys in Objects can be of strings or symbols but in Maps keys can be of any type.
- An Object has a prototype and may contain a few default keys which may collide with your own keys if you are not careful. A Map does not contain any keys by default.

- Objects are not iterables but Maps are.
- The number of items in an Object must be counted manually but for Maps it is readily available with the size property.
- Appart from storing data you can also attach functionality to an Object but for Maps it's just data(But functionality I mean Object Methods).
