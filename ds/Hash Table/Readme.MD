## Hash Table:- 
- A hash Table or a Hash Map is a data structure that is used to store key-value pairs.
- Given a key, you can associate a value of that key for very fast lookup.
- JS Objects are a special implementation of of hash table. However object class add it's own keys. Keys that you may input may conflict and overrite the default inherited properties.
