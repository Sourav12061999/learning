## Tree Data Structure
- #### Overview
   - A tree is a hirarchical ds that consists of nodes  connected by edges.
   - Tree is a non-lenear ds compared to array,string,linkedlist etc which are lenear ds.
   - In lenear ds, the time required to search is propotional to size of the data set.
   - Trees however being non lenear allow quicker and eaiser access to the data.
   - A tree will not contain any loops or cycles.

- #### Terminolagies
   - Node that doesn't have a parent node is called root node
   - Nodes  that doesn't have a child node is called leaf node
   - Degree:- The total no of child node it has.

- #### Binary Search Tree
  - A binary tree is a tree in which each node has atmost 2 child node. They are reffered to as left child and right child.
  - A binary search tree is a binary tree where each left node's value is <  the value of the parent node and each right node > the value of the parent node.

- #### Binary Search Tree Operations:- 
   - Insertion:- To add a node to the tree.
   - Search:- To find a node given it's value.
   - DFS(Depth First Search)
   - BFS(Breadth-first search)
   - Deletion:- Delete a node given it's value
